## Getting Started
Steps for building a server
2/20/2022 Sunday

1- Create server.js file

2- npm init -y

3- npm install express

4- const express = require("express")

5- const app = express()

6- app.listen(PORT, ()=>{ console.log("Anything") })

7- I can create end points (ex: app.get("/", helloWorldHandler))


8- I will create the function for that end point(ex: helloWorldHandler)

We continue building on the steps from the day before Additions

1- Instead of reading from the json file we send a request to a third party API

2- We read the documentation of the API and we tried on the Chrome or PostMan before we use it in our code.

3- We found that we should create an API Key

4- We installed Axios to send an HTTP request to the API.

5- Axios is returning a promise so I should write my code that depend on the request result in the .then function.

6- Axios is returng a huge object so I just care about the data property.

7- We found the API key should not shown in my code so we created .env file and add the API Key there

8- We installed dotenv library the configure it to make our server read the .env file.

9- We created .env.example where we show the required variable for any developer will work on the same project.

10- We created error handler: - We create a function. - We make our server know about it by using app.use - When i want to use I will use it in the .catch function.

11- We created new end point that take the parameter from the URl where we found it inside req.query


## Project Features
